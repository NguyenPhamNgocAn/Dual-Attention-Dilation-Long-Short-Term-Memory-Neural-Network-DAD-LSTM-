# Dual-Attention-Dilation-Long-Short-Term-Memory-Neural-Network-DAD-LSTM-
We propose the Dual Attention-Dilated Long Short-Term Memory (DAD-LSTM) model combining DA-RNN and Dilated Recurrent Neural Networks (DRNN) to forecast the future stock indices

We also replaced DRNN with RLSTM to examine whether or not the forecasting performance improved. Although the performance of RLSTM is impressive, it is not as good as DRNN.

The details of this model and project can be found in the pdf file called "DAD-LSTM" attached to this repo.
